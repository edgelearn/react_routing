# ReactJS Routing

Run the following command to get a basic ReactJS application setup with React Router:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install react-router-dom
yarn start

```

The documentation for the react-router-dom module is at https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start

1. Setup Routes

* Create 2 components in separate JS files within the my-app/src folder

* Setup the Router to use / for the App.js and 2 other paths for the 2 components created.

* Try in the browser to confirm that it is working.

2. Use Props for routes

* Modify one of the routes to include an ID as part of the URL

* Display the ID when that route is viewed by getting it from the props.

3. Parsing Query Parameter

* Print the query string in the other component from the props available.

* Install the query-string module

* Use the query-string to get each query parameter separately.

4. Navigating on Link Click

* Modify the Router to have Links for the 3 routes at the top of the page

After you have completed all of the exercises, commit your changes with the following command:

```
git commit -am "ReactJS Routing Examples"
